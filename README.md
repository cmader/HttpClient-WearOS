# ![Configuration screen](res/icon.svg) HttpClient-WearOS

HttpClient is an app that is currently available for Garmin (on the 
[connect iq store](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/da241207-e929-4cdf-9662-11ab17ffd70d)) and Wear OS 
based smartwatches (as APK [here](https://github.com/cmader/HttpClient-WearOS)). It allows you to 
send HTTP GET requests from your watch to configurable URLs (also called _endpoints_). You can give these requests a custom 
name and organize them in a hierarchy which is browsable on the watch in a convenient way.

The app has been developed with home automation use cases in mind where certain actions can be 
triggered by issuing an HTTP GET request to a local server that controls various appliances. 
However, numerous other use cases are imaginable as well.

## Endpoints Definition

As an input, the app requires an **Endpoints Definition** which is a textual description of all the 
requests that should be selectable on the watch. Here's an example:

```
- all,All
-- off,Office
--- shut_opn,Open shutter,/shut/office/open
--- shut_cls,Close shutter,/shut/office/close
-- liv,Living Room
--- l_on,Lights on,https://192.168.8.1/light/liv/on
-- kit,Kitchen
```

As you can see in the example above, the endpoint definition is structured hierarchically with the 
hierarchy level indicated by `-` characters. This level indicator is then followed by a unique 
identifier. After that, the request's human readably name as it will be shown on the watch display 
is given, and finally the HTTP request URL. All these elements are separated by comma.

The request url can be given both in "relative" format (i.e., providing only a path as shown 
with the office requests) or in absolute format, including protocol and host as it is the case with 
the living room request. If you use "relative" URLs, the app automatically adds a "Base URL" in 
front of the paths (see Section "App Configuration").

If the url is provided in absolute format, user credentials may be provided using this form:

    https://username:password@192.168.8.1/light/liv/on

In that case, username and password will be converted to a basic auth header and sent in the 
request.


## Configuration

HttpClient needs to access the Endpoints Definition from the (local) network. This is done by
providing an **Endpoints base URL** in the app's configuration screen (see Section "App
Configuration"). The app internally appends the path `/endpoints` to the Endpoints base URL. So if
you set your Endpoints base URL to, for instance, `https://example.org`, HttpClient tries to fetch
the Endpoints Definition from `https://example.org/endpoints`. **IMPORTANT**: The endpoints 
definition response must have the `Content-Type` header set to `text/plain`.

When the app is started for the first time, the following screen appears:

![Configuration screen](res/config_screen.png)

Here you can configure the Endpoints base URL that determines where the endpoint definition is
downloaded (see Section "Description"). In addition there is an option to show the 8 recently used
endpoints. If the option is activated,  it will show the entry "Recently Used" as first item on 
the top hierarchy level on the watch display. The config option *X-API-KEY* allows you to define
a value that is sent to the server by using the `X-API-KEY` header for *every* request. 

Pressing the back button of the watch confirms the configuration and brings up the endpoints 
interaction screen which is described in the section below.

## Endpoint Interaction

Getting back to our endpoint definition example above, this is how the first hierarchy level will 
be shown on the watch:

![Endpoint interaction main level](res/endpoints_interaction_main.png)

If you select "Office", the display will switch to the second hierarchy level, which is indicated 
on the top of the list:

![Endpoint interaction second_level](res/endpoints_interaction_level2.png)

Tapping on one of the "shutter" entries issues the request.

### Display of Response Text

If the HTTP requests returns a response text with HTTP status `200` and `Content-Type` header set 
to `text/plain`, the text is shown by the app in a separate view. You can see an example with a 
sensor's temperature reading below:

![Response result text](res/response_result_text.png)

### Additional Endpoint Options

The behavior of the application can be controlled by adding specific markers to an endpoint's identifier.
These are described in the following.

#### Menu Item Colors

Each endpoint in the Endpoints Definition will be represented by a menu item. By default these items
are shown with a blue background. However, the color can be also set manually by adding the `#` character
followed by the color name to the endpoint's identifier. For example, to have all items in the
Office section from the example above shown in blue color, the line needs to be changed like this:

    -- off#blue,Office

This results into the following output:

![Blue office menu item](res/colored_menuitem.png)

Currently the following color names are supported:

* red
* green
* blue
* yellow
* cyan
* black
* magenta
* darkgray
* lightgray
* gray

#### Ignore Error Response

Sometimes an API behaves strange and calling it always results in an error response even though the 
request has been received and processed. In that case, you can suppress the error dialog that is
usually shown in the application by adding an exclamation mark `!` to the end of an endpoint's
identifier like this:

    --- l_on!,Lights on,https://192.168.8.1/light/liv/on

## Installation

To install the app you need to download the `.apk` file from 
[this](https://github.com/cmader/HttpClient-WearOS) repository. After that, the file must be 
transferred to the Wear OS device (smartwatch). There are several guides how to do this, for 
example [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/sideload-apps-wear-os-galaxy-watch/) and 
[here](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-install-apps-on-wear-os-all-methods.4510255/). Just use the
method you're most comfortable with.

### Compatibility

The app has been tested with Wear OS 4, API level 33 and 28 with round display (1.2") in the 
emulator and on a Samsung Galaxy watch 5.

If you experience any bugs or issues using the app, please contact me! The software is developed
as a personal leisure time side project with no commercial interest whatsoever. Hence no ads, nag
screens, donate buttons or other annoying stuff.
